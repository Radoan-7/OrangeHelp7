# OrangeHelp 🚀

**Because sometimes, finding help feels harder than the problem itself.**

## What is OrangeHelp?  
Imagine you’re stuck with a broken door knob in your dorm and you don’t know a single trustworthy person to fix it. That’s exactly what happened to me, and it was frustrating beyond words. So, I built **OrangeHelp** — a friendly, free community platform where neighbors can **request help**, **offer help**, or even **donate resources** easily and safely.

Whether you need someone to pick up groceries, tutor your kid, fix a leaky faucet, or just watch your dog for the weekend, OrangeHelp connects you with people nearby who want to help — no strings attached.

## Why Does It Matter?  
Affordable, reliable help isn’t always easy to find, especially in underserved areas. Traditional services can be costly or inaccessible. OrangeHelp flips that by empowering communities to support each other directly. It’s all about trust, connection, and turning small favors into big community impact.

## What I Learned  
Creating OrangeHelp taught me how vital trust and simplicity are in building community tools. I honed my skills in React and UX design while solving a problem that personally hit home. This project is as much about coding as it is about connecting people.
